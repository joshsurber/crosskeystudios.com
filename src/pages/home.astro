      <p>
        We leverage <strong>Astro</strong> and hand-coded CSS to eliminate the framework
        bloat that chokes modern sites. By writing every line of code ourselves, we
        deliver maximum speed and a hardened security profile.
      </p>

    <!-- Combined WP & Block Themes -->
    <Card title="Custom WordPress" subtitle="Full Control. Zero Weight.">
      <p>
        For teams that need a robust CMS, we build WordPress themes from scratch
        using modern <strong>Block Themes</strong>. No heavy frameworks—just
        clean, purposeful PHP tailored strictly to your business workflow.
      </p>

    <!-- Specific Storefront Focus -->
    <Card title="Bespoke WooCommerce" subtitle="Lean E-commerce Logic.">
      <p>
        We leverage WooCommerce without the "plugin fatigue." By using a
        bare-minimum footprint, we build high-conversion storefronts that stay
        fast, secure, and easy for your team to manage.

      <p>
        The best of both worlds: keep the WordPress dashboard your team knows,
        integrated with an Astro front-end. It’s the ultimate setup for speed,
        scalability, and airtight security.
      </p>

        locked in. Our efficient builds reduce ongoing maintenance and server
        costs, keeping you online as cheaply and reliably as possible.

        architecture patched and optimized for algorithm shifts. We don't just
        maintain; we keep your site ahead of the curve.
