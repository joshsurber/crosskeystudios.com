    <!-- Combined Astro & Hand-Coding -->
    <Card title="Performance Architecture">
      <strong>Sub-Second Velocity by Design.</strong>
      <p>
        We leverage <strong>Astro</strong> and hand-coded CSS to eliminate the framework
        bloat that chokes modern sites. By writing every line of code ourselves, we
        deliver maximum speed and a hardened security profile.
      </p>

    <!-- Combined WP & Block Themes -->
    <Card title="Custom WordPress">
      <strong>Full Control. Zero Weight.</strong>
      <p>
        For teams that need a robust CMS, we build WordPress themes from scratch
        using modern <strong>Block Themes</strong>. No heavy frameworks—just
        clean, purposeful PHP tailored strictly to your business workflow.

    <!-- Specific Storefront Focus -->
    <Card title="Bespoke WooCommerce">
      <strong>Lean E-commerce Logic.</strong>
      <p>
        We leverage WooCommerce without the "plugin fatigue." By using a
        bare-minimum footprint, we build high-conversion storefronts that stay
        fast, secure, and easy for your team to manage.

        The best of both worlds: keep the WordPress dashboard your team knows,
        integrated with an Astro front-end. It’s the ultimate setup for speed,
        scalability, and airtight security.

        locked in. Our efficient builds reduce ongoing maintenance and server
        costs, keeping you online as cheaply and reliably as possible.
