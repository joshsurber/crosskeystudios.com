      I’m always open to discussing new projects, whether it’s a full site build
      or a custom plugin for an existing WordPress setup.

  Focus: Direct and personal.
  <br />
  Headline: Reach Out to the Studio.
  <br />
  Message: I’m always open to discussing new projects, whether it’s a full site build
  or a custom plugin for an existing WordPress setup.
  <br />
  The Form: Simple Name, Email, and "Tell me about your project" fields.
  <br />
  Focus: Lead qualification.
  <br />
  Headline: Start the Transmission.
  <br />
  Form Logic: Instead of just a "Message" box, ask:
  <br />
  "What is the biggest bottleneck in your current digital presence?"
  <br />
  "What does a 'successful' launch look like to you?"
  <br />
  Location: Mention you are a local San Antonio studio but operate on a global digital
  frequency.
