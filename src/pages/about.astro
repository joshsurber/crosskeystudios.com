<Layout title="From Cross Key Drive to the Digital Frontier.">
  <Section title="The Story">
    <p>
      Cross Key Studios started with a simple, gut-level belief: the web should
      feel like it was built by a person, for a person.
    </p>

    <p>
      That idea didn’t come to life in a boardroom. It happened while our
      founder was living at his mother-in-law’s house, watching firsthand how
      the modern web can quietly push people away. We saw how sites designed on
      high-end gear and fiber optics often leave anyone on an older device or a
      spotty connection behind. The "weight" of a heavy website is invisible to
      a developer, but it's a real barrier for a regular person just trying to
      get things done.
    </p>

    <p>
      We took our name from the street where those first conversations happened.
      Today, Cross Key Studios exists to build websites that actually respect
      your time and your tools. To us, making things fast, accessible, and
      durable isn't an "extra"—it’s just the right way to do it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whether you’re a small business, a nonprofit, or a solo creator, we’re
      here to build you a digital home that works for everyone and stands the
      test of time.
    </p>
  </Section>

  <Section title="The Approach">
    <p>
      We don’t rely on page builders, templates, or one-size-fits-all
      frameworks. We write the code that runs your site—intentionally and from
      scratch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like a tailored suit, a hand-coded website fits your business without the
      bulk of off-the-rack solutions. By avoiding heavy libraries and redundant
      plugins, we create sites that load faster, break less often, and are
      easier to maintain over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every line of code has a purpose. That discipline reduces technical debt,
      minimizes conflicts during updates, and keeps your site stable as your
      business evolves.
    </p>

  <Section title="The Studio Philosophy">
    <p>The modern web is bloated.</p>
    <p>
      <a
        href="https://www.toptal.com/designers/ux/ux-statistics-insights-infographic"
        >Nearly 40% of users abandon a site that takes longer than three seconds
        to load</a
      >, yet most websites are built on templates packed with unused code. Using
      a generic template is like building a house with a Swiss Army knife—it
      works, but it’s never the right tool.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Cross Key Studios, we strip away shortcuts and build with intent. Clean
      code. Clear structure. Performance as a foundation, not an afterthought.
    </p>
  </Section>

  <Section title="What We Don’t Do">
    <ul>
      <li>We don’t chase trends for the sake of novelty.</li>
      <li>We don’t ship bloated sites held together by plugins.</li>
      <li>
        We don’t disappear after launch or lock clients into platforms they
        don’t control.
      </li>
      <li>
        If a solution adds unnecessary weight, complexity, or fragility, we
        don’t use it—no matter how popular it is.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </Section>

  <Section title="The Human Element">
    <p>
      Based in San Antonio, we work with thoughtful brands locally and globally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cross Key Studios is intentionally small. While projects are collaborative
      and supported by trusted partners when needed, you’ll always work directly
      with the people architecting and building your site.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are no hand-offs to junior account managers and no black-box
      process. Just clear communication, honest timelines, and a direct
      partnership from the first conversation to launch.
