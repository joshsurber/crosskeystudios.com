  <h1>From Cross Key Drive to the Digital Frontier.</h1>

  <Section title="The Story">
    <p>
      Cross Key Studios began with a simple belief: the web should be built by
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea took shape while our founder was living at his mother-in-law’s
      house, where we saw firsthand how modern websites quietly fail users on
      older devices and slower connections. Developers on high-end machines and
      fiber connections rarely feel the cost of a heavy site—but everyday users
      do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Named after the street where it all began, Cross Key Studios exists to
      build websites that respect users, devices, and attention. Performance,
      accessibility, and longevity aren’t premium features here—they’re the
      baseline.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, we build performance-focused websites for small businesses,
      nonprofits, and solo operators who want sites that last.
    </p>
  </Section>

  <Section title="The Approach">
    <p>
      We don’t rely on page builders, templates, or one-size-fits-all
      frameworks. We write the code that runs your site—intentionally and from
      scratch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like a tailored suit, a hand-coded website fits your business without the
      bulk of off-the-rack solutions. By avoiding heavy libraries and redundant
      plugins, we create sites that load faster, break less often, and are
      easier to maintain over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every line of code has a purpose. That discipline reduces technical debt,
      minimizes conflicts during updates, and keeps your site stable as your
      business evolves.
    </p>
  </Section>

  <Section title="The Studio Philosophy">
    <p>The modern web is bloated.</p>
    <p>
      Nearly 40% of users abandon a site that takes longer than three seconds to
      load, yet most websites are built on templates packed with unused code.
      Using a generic template is like building a house with a Swiss Army
      knife—it works, but it’s never the right tool.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Cross Key Studios, we strip away shortcuts and build with intent. Clean
      code. Clear structure. Performance as a foundation, not an afterthought.
    </p>
  </Section>

  <Section title="What We Don’t Do">
    <ul>
      <li>We don’t chase trends for the sake of novelty.</li>
      <li>We don’t ship bloated sites held together by plugins.</li>
      <li>
        We don’t disappear after launch or lock clients into platforms they
        don’t control.
      </li>
      <li>
        If a solution adds unnecessary weight, complexity, or fragility, we
        don’t use it—no matter how popular it is.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </Section>

  <Section title="The Human Element">
    <p>
      Based in San Antonio, we work with thoughtful brands locally and globally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cross Key Studios is intentionally small. While projects are collaborative
      and supported by trusted partners when needed, you’ll always work directly
      with the people architecting and building your site.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are no hand-offs to junior account managers and no black-box
      process. Just clear communication, honest timelines, and a direct
      partnership from the first conversation to launch.
    </p>
