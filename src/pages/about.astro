  <h1>From Cross Key Drive to the Digital Frontier.</h1>

  <Section title="The Story">
    Cross Key Studios started with a simple idea: that the web should be built
    by hand. Named after the street where the vision first took shape, the
    studio is dedicated to the craft of web development.
  </Section>

  <Section title="The Approach">
    I don't hide behind a library or a framework. I write the code that runs
    your site, ensuring every pixel and every line of CSS has a purpose.
    <br />
    Focus: The Origin Story and the Studio Vibe.
  </Section>

  <Section title="The Studio Philosophy">
    Cross Key Studios was born from the idea that the web has become too
    bloated. We stripped away the heavy plugins and the "good enough" templates
    to return to clean, purposeful engineering.
    <br />
    Focus: Your unique perspective as a developer.

  <Section title="The Human Element">
    Based in San Antonio, we work with forward-thinking brands globally. We are
    a small, focused studio—when you work with us, you speak directly to the
    architects building your site.
