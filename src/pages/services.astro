      <h1>The Architecture of Performance</h1>
      <p>
        We don’t just build websites; we engineer digital assets that
        outperform, outrun, and outlast the competition.

      <Card title="The Hand-Coded Advantage">
        <strong>Clean Code is a Competitive Edge.</strong>
        <p>
          Mainstream agencies rely on "page builders" that choke your site with
          thousands of lines of junk code. We hand-code every pixel. The result:
          sub-second load times, flawless security, and a site that feels as
          lightweight as it is powerful.

      <Card title="The WordPress Alternative">
        <strong>Ditch the Frameworks, Keep the Power.</strong>
        <p>
          If you need a CMS, don’t settle for a bloated theme. We build
          WordPress from the ground up—zero heavy frameworks, zero clunky
          plugins. Just lean PHP and CSS tailored strictly to your business
          requirements.

      <Card title="The Technical Edge">
        <strong>Astro & Tailwind Architecture.</strong>
        <p>
          We bridge the gap between static speed and dynamic scalability. By
          leveraging <strong>Astro</strong> for instant delivery and <strong
            >Tailwind CSS</strong
          > for precision responsiveness, your site is optimized for the modern web
          on every device.

      <Card title="The Hybrid Setup">
        <strong>10x Speed. 100% Familiarity.</strong>
        <p>
          Keep the WordPress editor your team loves; lose the performance
          bottlenecks. Our "Headless" setups decouple your content from the
          front-end, delivering a UI that is 10x faster and exponentially more
          secure than standard themes.
        </p>
      </Card>

      <Card title="Maintenance & Security">
        <strong>The "Key Update" Protocol.</strong>
        <p>
          The web never stops moving. Our monthly "Key Updates" ensure your
          architecture stays patched, prioritized, and ahead of search engine
          algorithm shifts. We don't just maintain; we optimize.

  Focus: Quality over quantity and the "No-Template" promise.
  <br />
  Headline: What We Build.
  <br />
  The Hand-Coded Advantage: We don't use "page builders" that bloat your site with
  thousands of lines of unnecessary code. Every layout is hand-coded to ensure your
  site is as lightweight as it is beautiful.
  <br />
  The WordPress Alternative: We offer custom WordPress development for those who need
  a robust CMS, but we build our themes from scratch—no heavy frameworks, just clean
  PHP and CSS.
  <br />
  The Hybrid Approach: We bridge the gap between static speed (Astro) and dynamic
  content management.
  <br />
  Focus: Proving technical depth (The "How").
  <br />
  The Technical Edge: We utilize Astro for sub-second load times and Tailwind CSS
  for pixel-perfect responsiveness.
  <br />
  The WordPress Integration: For teams that love the WordPress editor, we offer "Headless"
  setups. You get the UI you know, with a front-end that is 10x faster and significantly
  more secure than standard themes.
  <br />
  Maintenance & Security: Monthly "Key Updates" to ensure your site stays patched,
  fast, and ahead of search engine algorithm changes.
