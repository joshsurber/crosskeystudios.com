<Layout>
  Focus: Quality over quantity and the "No-Template" promise.
  <br />
  Headline: What We Build.
  <br />
  The Hand-Coded Advantage: We don't use "page builders" that bloat your site with
  thousands of lines of unnecessary code. Every layout is hand-coded to ensure your
  site is as lightweight as it is beautiful.
  <br />
  The WordPress Alternative: We offer custom WordPress development for those who need
  a robust CMS, but we build our themes from scratch—no heavy frameworks, just clean
  PHP and CSS.
  <br />
  The Hybrid Approach: We bridge the gap between static speed (Astro) and dynamic
  content management.
  <br />
  Focus: Proving technical depth (The "How").
  <br />
  The Technical Edge: We utilize Astro for sub-second load times and Tailwind CSS
  for pixel-perfect responsiveness.
  <br />
  The WordPress Integration: For teams that love the WordPress editor, we offer "Headless"
  setups. You get the UI you know, with a front-end that is 10x faster and significantly
  more secure than standard themes.
  <br />
  Maintenance & Security: Monthly "Key Updates" to ensure your site stays patched,
  fast, and ahead of search engine algorithm changes.
